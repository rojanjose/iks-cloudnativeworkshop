# Exercise 3 - Deploy the Guestbook app with Istio Proxy

The Guestbook app is a sample app for users to leave comments. It consists of a web front end, Redis master for storage, and a replicated set of Redis slaves. We will also integrate the app with Watson Tone Analyzer which detects the sentiment in users' comments and replies with emoticons.

## Download the Guestbook app

1. Clone the Guestbook app into the current directory `docs/plans`.

    ```shell
    git clone -b kubecon2019 https://github.com/remkohdev/guestbook
    ```

1. Navigate into the app directory.

    ```shell
    cd guestbook/v2
    ```

## Enable the automatic sidecar injection for the default namespace

In Kubernetes, a sidecar is a utility container in the pod, and its purpose is to support the main container. For Istio to work, Envoy proxies must be deployed as sidecars to each pod of the deployment. There are two ways of injecting the Istio sidecar into a pod: manually using the istioctl CLI tool or automatically using the Istio sidecar injector. In this exercise, we will use the automatic sidecar injection provided by Istio.

1. Annotate the default namespace to enable automatic sidecar injection:

    ``` shell
    kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
    ```

1. Validate the namespace is annotated for automatic sidecar injection:

    ``` shell
    kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
    ```

    Sample output:

    ``` shell
    NAME             STATUS   AGE    ISTIO-INJECTION
    default          Active   271d   enabled
    istio-system     Active   5d2h
    ...
    ```

## Create a Redis database

The Redis database is a service that you can use to persist the data of your app. The Redis database comes with a master and slave modules.

1. Create the Redis controllers and services for both the master and the slave.

    ``` shell
    kubectl create -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
    kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml
    kubectl create -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml
    kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml
    ```

1. Verify that the Redis controllers for the master and the slave are created.

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployment
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    redis-master   1/1     1            1           2m16s
    redis-slave    2/2     2            2           2m15s
    ```

1. Verify that the Redis services for the master and the slave are created.

    ```shell
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
    kubernetes     ClusterIP      172.21.0.1      <none>          443/TCP        23h
    redis-master   ClusterIP      172.21.85.39    <none>          6379/TCP       5d
    redis-slave    ClusterIP      172.21.205.35   <none>          6379/TCP       5d
    ```

1. Verify that the Redis pods for the master and the slave are up and running.

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    redis-master-4sswq              2/2       Running   0          5d
    redis-slave-kj8jp               2/2       Running   0          5d
    redis-slave-nslps               2/2       Running   0          5d
    ```

## Install the Guestbook app

1. Inject the Istio Envoy sidecar into the guestbook pods, and deploy the Guestbook app on to the Kubernetes cluster. Deploy both the v1 and v2 versions of the app:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f ../v1/guestbook-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
    ```

    These commands deploy the Guestbook app on to the Kubernetes cluster. Since we enabled automation sidecar injection, these pods will be also include an Envoy sidecar as they are started in the cluster. Here we have two versions of deployments, a new version (`v2`) in the current directory, and a previous version (`v1`) in a sibling directory. They will be used in future sections to showcase the Istio traffic routing capabilities.

1. Create the guestbook service.

    ```shell
    kubectl create -f guestbook-service.yaml
    ```

1. Verify that the service was created.

    ```shell
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    Output:

    ```shell
    NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
    guestbook      LoadBalancer   172.21.36.181   169.61.37.140   80:32149/TCP   5d
    ...
    ```

1. Verify that the pods are up and running.

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```shell
    NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    guestbook-v1-9dbd6cf86-7xvsl    2/2     Running   0          57s
    guestbook-v2-7769488b85-hhzf9   2/2     Running   0          57s
    redis-master-7bf5f6d487-c86jg   2/2     Running   0          2m9s
    redis-slave-58db457857-8hjcn    2/2     Running   0          9m16s
    redis-slave-58db457857-ckj2x    2/2     Running   0          9m16s
    ```

    Note that each guestbook pod has 2 containers in it. One is the guestbook container, and the other is the Envoy proxy sidecar.

Great! Your guestbook app is up and running. In the next exercise you will expose the Istio service mesh with the Ingress Gateway
